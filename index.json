However, SNe~Ia have shown to be more homogeneous in the near-infrared (NIR), where the effect of dust extinction is also attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility of using a low number of NIR observations for accurate distance estimations, given the homogeneity at these wavelengths. We found that one epoch in J and/or H band, plus good extit{gr}-band coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak magnitudes in the J (Jmax) and H (Hmax) bands. The use of a single NIR epoch only introduces an additional scatter of ~$0.05$ mag for epochs around the time of extit{B}-band peak magnitude (Tmax). We also tested the effect of optical cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of Tmax and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak magnitudes.

We test PISCOLA on large-scale simulations of type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) to validate its performance, and show it successfully retrieves rest-frame peak magnitudes for average survey cadences of up to 7 days. We also compare to the existing SN Ia light-curve fitter SALT2 on real data, and find only small (but significant) disagreements for different light-curve parameters. As a proof-of-concept of an application of PISCOLA, we decomposed and analysed the PISCOLA rest-frame light-curves of SNe Ia from the Pantheon SN Ia sample with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization. Our new parametrization provides a similar performance to existing light-curve fitters such as SALT2.

With these improvements comes an increasing number of poorly-understood events discovered such as tidal disruption events, Ca-rich transients, superluminous SNe, rapidly evolving transients, kilonovae, and other peculiar transients. Hence, an ever-increasing focus of the time-domain community is in exploring this diversity and populating the Luminosity-Timescale phase space with these and other “gap” transients and understanding their powering mechanisms, progenitors, and environments in which they are found, from an observational and theoretical point of view. These next-generation facilities will play a crucial role in exploring these issues. Therefore, the goal of this session is to create a space to foster collaboration and discuss these uncommon types of transients, what we have learnt about them, and how to direct future research, theoretical modelling and observations with the next-generation facilities towards a better understanding of them. As part of our commitment to improving the equality, diversity and inclusivity of our field, we will take active measures to provide a platform for scientists from groups that are typically underrepresented in astronomy, including but not limited to women as well as ethnic minorities.

Since this event, numerous wide-field surveys have been optimising search strategies to maximise their efficiency of detecting these fast and faint transients. With the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), we have been conducting a volume limited survey for intrinsically faint and fast fading events to a distance of D≃200 Mpc. Two promising candidates have been identified from this archival search, with sparse data - PS15cey and PS17cke. Here we present more detailed analysis and discussion of their nature. We observe that PS15cey was a luminous, fast declining transient at 320 Mpc. Models of BH-NS mergers with a very stiff equation of state could possibly reproduce the luminosity and decline but the physical parameters are extreme. A more likely scenario is that this was a SN2018kzr-like merger event. PS17cke was a faint and fast declining event at 15 Mpc. We explore several explosion scenarios of this transient including models of it as a NS-NS and BH-NS merger, the outburst of a massive luminous star, and compare it against other known fast fading transients. Although there is uncertainty in the explosion scenario due to difficulty in measuring the explosion epoch, we find PS17cke to be a plausible kilonova candidate from the model comparisons.","tags":null,"title":"PS15cey and PS17cke: prospective candidates from the Pan-STARRS Search for Kilonovae","type":"other publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This post was edited by Cristobel Soares. Check this link for the SEPnet version of it.\n Every year SEPnet provides an opportunity to a group of postgraduate researchers to organise a two-day student-led conference at the University of Southampton. I first came to know about this when I applied for a talk at the Astronomy conference from 2019 ( From Infinity to Zero: the history of the Universe in redshift). These types of conferences are perfect for early career researchers as it is organised by students, for students, although a few academic speakers are also invited. You do not feel the same pressure as with the big international conferences where you find all the “big names” from your research field. In addition, you also get to know lots of people in the same career stages as you and share experiences.\nAfter the 2019 conference I attended was over, I got very interested in organising one of my own. I talked to Elizabeth Swann, University of Portsmouth, the lead organiser to ask her for advice (this was really helpful!). I got very excited with the idea, so I decided to ask around in my Astronomy department for fellow PGRs who might be interested in organising a conference and started writing a proposal. At the same time a group of PGRs from the University of Hertfordshire were writing one of their own. They kindly suggested to work together instead of competing, so we started collaborating on a single proposal (after all, isn’t this what research is all about?).\nChoosing the topic of the conference was relatively easy. As many big telescopes and surveys are coming in the near future, we thought it might be a good idea to focus on big data and machine learning, thus, the title of the conference: The Big Data Era in Astronomy. Finding academic speakers wasn’t too hard either. As several of us in the organising committee work on different fields, we quickly came up with a list of candidates. Cristobel Soares, Graduate Network Manager, was in charge of the logistics and funding and very helpful with her advice and support. We mainly had to focus on the structure, science and social events (eg, a conference dinner) at the meeting. Everything was going according to plan as the conference date was approaching, however, everything changed when the COVID-19 pandemic struck.\nMany things were quite uncertain at that time. We didn’t know how long and how much this pandemic would affect everyone, so we had to postpone the conference. As time passed, we grew impatient. We didn’t know if we were going to have the opportunity to host the meeting or if we would have to cancel it. Eventually, we decided to do what many other conferences, schools and workshops were doing, choose a new date and go virtual!\nThis was full of challenges. We didn’t have to worry about funding, conference dinner and other logistics, but we did have to think about the proper platforms to host our virtual conference on. Thankfully, all SEPnet universities have access to Microsoft Teams, so we chose it as our platform for hosting the talks. In addition, Slack is widely used in academic environments as it is perfect for asynchronous discussions, questions, announcements, etc. We also decided to use Slido for the questions at the end of each talk, which was quite new to all of us. I actually got to know about Slido during an ESO conference I attended in June.\nUnfortunately, as things were still uncertain close to the new date of the conference in September, many of the students were unable to attend. Therefore, we had to shorten the length of the conference from two days to one and cut the number of sessions by half. However, the conference turned out better than expected.\nFrom the feedback from the participants we learnt that the length of the conference (including the length of talks, breaks, etc.) worked well. Furthermore, the platforms used (Microsoft Teams, Slack, Slido) were really useful and the attendees found the conference was worth attending. Nonetheless, most of them, given the opportunity to choose, would prefer an in-person meeting instead of a virtual one.\n","date":1600214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600214400,"objectID":"e8ab4073970685b0e797b75c1b82b97a","permalink":"https://temuller.github.io/post/student_led_conference/","publishdate":"2020-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/student_led_conference/","section":"post","summary":"This post was edited by Cristobel Soares.

At early times, the light curve shows a fast rise (∼6 − 8 days) to a peak of M$_g^{max} = -17.84$ mag, followed by a very rapid decline of 7.94 ± 0.48 mag per 100 days in the V −band. The extensive photometric coverage at late phases shows that the radioactive tail has two slopes, one steeper than that expected from the decay of 56Co (between 100 and 350 days), and another slower (after 450 days), probably produced by an additional energy source. From the bolometric light curve, we estimated that the amount of ejected 56Ni is ∼0.059 ± 0.003 M⊙. The nebular spectra of SN 2017ivv show a remarkable transformation that allows the evolution to be split into three phases: (1) Hα strong phase (500 days). We find that the nebular analysis favours a binary progenitor and an asymmetric explosion.

This event provides an apparently rare opportunity to view the inner workings of an interacting supernova. The observed properties can be explained by the explosion of a star in an aspherical CSM. The initial light is emitted from an extended CSM (∼4000 R⊙), which ionises the exterior unshocked material. Some days after, the SN photosphere envelops this region, leading to the appearance of a SN IIb. Over time, the photosphere recedes in velocity space, revealing interaction between the supernova ejecta and the CSM that partially obscures the supernova nebular phase. Modelling of the initial spectrum reveals a surface composition consistent with compact H-deficient Wolf-Rayet and LBV stars.

High cadence follow-up spectra show broad Balmer lines and He i in early spectra, with He ii making an appearance after ∼70–100 d. The Balmer lines evolve from a smooth broad profile, through a boxy, asymmetric double-peaked phase consistent with accretion disc emission, and back to smooth at late times. The Balmer lines are unlike typical active galactic nucleus in that they show a flat Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ ∼ 1.5), suggesting the lines are collisionally excited rather than being produced via photoionization. The flat Balmer decrement together with the complex profiles suggests that the emission lines originate in a disc chromosphere, analogous to those seen in cataclysmic variables. The low optical depth of material due to a possible partial disruption may be what allows us to observe these double-peaked, collisionally excited lines.

We present optical+UV photometry of the transient, as well as an X-ray spectrum and radio upper limits. The bolometric light curve of AT 2018hyz is comparable to other known TDEs and declines at a rate consistent with a t−5/3 at early times, emitting a total radiated energy of E = 9 × 1050 erg. An excess bump appears in the UV light curve about 50 d after bolometric peak, followed by a flattening beyond 250 d. We detect a constant X-ray source present for at least 86 d. The X-ray spectrum shows a total unabsorbed flux of ∼4 × 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 and is best fit by a blackbody plus power-law model with a photon index of Γ = 0.8. A thermal X-ray model is unable to account for photons \\\u0026gt;1 keV, while a radio non-detection favours inverse-Compton scattering rather than a jet for the non-thermal component. We model the optical and UV light curves using the Modular Open-Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) and find a best fit for a black hole of 5.2 × 106 M⊙ disrupting a 0.1 M⊙ star; the model suggests the star was likely only partially disrupted, based on the derived impact parameter of β = 0.6. The low optical depth implied by the small debris mass may explain how we are able to see hydrogen emission with disc-like line profiles in the spectra of AT 2018hyz (see our companion paper).","tags":null,"title":"The Tidal Disruption Event AT 2018hyz II: Light-curve modelling of a partially disrupted star","type":"other publications"},{"authors":["Tomás E.

The peak bolometric luminosity, L$_{\\rm bol} \\approx 10^{41.4}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$, and its spectral evolution is typical of other SNe in the class. Using our late-time spectra, we measure the [\\ion{O}{i}] $\\lambda\\lambda6300, 6364$ lines, which we compare against SN II spectral synthesis models to constrain the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass. We find this to be 12 $\\pm$ 3\\,\\msun. Our extensive late-time spectral coverage of the [\\ion{Fe}{ii}] $\\lambda7155$ and [\\ion{Ni}{ii}] $\\lambda7378$ lines permits a measurement of the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, a parameter sensitive to the inner progenitor structure and explosion mechanism dynamics. We measure a constant abundance ratio evolution of $0.081^{+0.009}_{-0.010}$, and argue that the best epochs to measure the ratio are at $\\sim$200 -- 300\\,days after explosion. We place this measurement in the context of a large sample of SNe II and compare against various physical, light-curve and spectral parameters, in search of trends which might allow indirect ways of constraining this ratio. We do not find correlations predicted by theoretical models; however, this may be the result of the exact choice of parameters and explosion mechanism in the models, the simplicity of them and/or primordial contamination in the measured abundance ratio.","tags":null,"title":"The low-luminosity type II SN 2016aqf: A well-monitored spectral evolution of the Ni/Fe abundance ratio","type":"publication"},{"authors":[" Pursiainen, M.","Gutiérrez, C.

More than 200 SNe have been targeted, but there are even more SNe that have been observed serendipitously.

A Type II-P Supernova (SN II-P) is a common type of CCSN which shows a \u0026ldquo;plateau\u0026rdquo; in its light curve, driven by a Hydrogen-rich envelope. Observations of the explosion site of some of these objects have shown that the progenitors of these explosions are Red Supergiant (RSG) stars. From these data several predictions can be made by comparing with stellar evolution models. One test that can be made is to determine the initial mass of the progenitor (the mass at the Main-Sequence), which can be done by comparing the luminosity of the progenitor with model predictions. Another way is to measure the mass of the Hydrogen-rich envelope by modelling the light curve and making some assumptions about the core mass. A different way is to measure spectral lines of some elements, like Oxygen, at late time (more than 120 days after the explosion, approximately), which correlates with the initial mass as shown by some models.\nUnfortunately, these methods do not agree in general, so a proper estimation of the initial mass of the progenitor of a SN II-P can not be made. Having this in mind, the authors of the article proposed a different way of estimating the initial mass by measuring the surface composition (or surface abundance) of the progenitor star at early epochs (less than 1 day approximately). There are two main reasons for this: firstly, at this stage some spectral features are easy to identify, and secondly, the surface abundance is not expected to suffer from explosive mixing at early time, which erases any link to the progenitor mass.\nTo test this, the authors make use of the MESA code to study sets of evolutionary models. The evolution across the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram is key to understand the different processes and phases a star goes through, so the authors use MESA to evolve stars with different initial masses to study this. As it can be seen in Figure 1, less massive stars cross the H-R diagram more rapidly than more massive star, which means that more massive stars have more time to dredge up material from the inner layers into the surface (mixing the abundances) before the end of the RSG phase. Another factor that has to be taken into account is the mass loss. In general, more massive star loose more mass than the least massive ones, so their outer envelopes are thinner compared to the total size of the star, hence their surface abundances suffer from more mixing.\nFig. 1: H-R diagram for stars with different initial masses as labelled. The circles mark evenly-spaced time steps. The stars indicate the beginning of the RSG phase. More massive stars take longer to cross the H-R diagram than less massive stars.\nSince the surface abundance can not be directly measured, an indirect way of measurement was developed. The authors demonstrate that the surface abundance can be estimated by measuring the ratio between spectral lines, specifically the Carbon-to-Nitrogen ratio, a few hours after the supernova explosion. They simulate early time supernova spectra coming from stars with three different initial masses. The results of these simulated spectra are shown in Figure 2 for a 15 and 25 solar masses stars, for three epochs: 3.1, 12.0 and 24.0 hours after the explosion. One can clearly see the greater strength of Nitrogen lines in the higher mass model, and the greater strength of Carbon and Oxygen lines in the lower mass model. These same trends have been seen in the observed early-time spectra of SN II-P, however, the lack of data at these early stages is clear.\nFig. 2: Early-time SN II-P spectra for progenitors of 15 (blue) and 25 (red) solar masses. From top to bottom, spectra of 3.1, 12.0 and 24.0 hours after explosion. It can be seen the difference in the strengths of lines for the two progenitors.\nLike the other methods mentioned above, the surface abundance method suffers from several uncertainties, but no further comparison is given. Finally, the author estimate that within the next decade several early time spectra of SN II-P should be available, which would help decreasing the uncertainties for a better estimation of the initial masses of their progenitors.\n","date":1548633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548633600,"objectID":"27e37ed592eadecbabf2fc9471d3e585","permalink":"https://temuller.github.io/post/astrobites/","publishdate":"2019-01-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/astrobites/","section":"post","summary":"See below a guest post I wrote for Astrobites.

Its proximity allowed a very early detection and triggering of multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up well before maximum light. The velocity dispersion of the host galaxy and fits to the TDE light curve indicate a black hole mass ≍106-=M☉, disrupting a star of ≍1-=M☉. By analysing our comprehensive UV, optical, and X-ray data, we show that the early optical emission is dominated by an outflow, with a luminosity evolution L ∝ t2, consistent with a photosphere expanding at constant velocity (≳2000-=km-=s-1), and a line-forming region producing initially blueshifted H and He-=II profiles with v = 3000-10-=000-=km-=s-1. The fastest optical ejecta approach the velocity inferred from radio detections (modelled in a forthcoming companion paper from K. D. Alexander et al.), thus the same outflow may be responsible for both the fast optical rise and the radio emission - the first time this connection has been observed in a TDE. The light-curve rise begins 29 ± 2 d before maximum light, peaking when the photosphere reaches the radius where optical photons can escape. The photosphere then undergoes a sudden transition, first cooling at constant radius then contracting at constant temperature. At the same time, the blueshifts disappear from the spectrum and Bowen fluorescence lines (N-=III) become prominent, implying a source of far-UV photons, while the X-ray light curve peaks at ≍1041-=erg-=s-1. Assuming that these X-rays are from prompt accretion, the size and mass of the outflow are consistent with the reprocessing layer needed to explain the large optical to X-ray ratio in this and other optical TDEs, possibly favouring accretion-powered over collision-powered outflow models.","tags":null,"title":"An outflow powers the optical rise of the nearby, fast-evolving tidal disruption event AT2019qiz","type":"other publications"}]
